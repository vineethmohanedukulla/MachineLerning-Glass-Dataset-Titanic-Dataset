##  Classification algorithm, Scikit learn
### Lesson and Assignment Objectives
### **Question 1**
1. Numpy: (Titanic Dataset)
    1. Find the correlation between ‘survived’ (target column) and ‘sex’ column for the Titanic use case in class.
        1. Do you think we should keep this feature?
2. Do at least two visualizations to describe or show correlations. (e.g.: Survived: Class and gender).
3. Implement Naïve Bayes method using scikit-learn library and report the accuracy  
### **Question 2**    
1. Implement Naïve Bayes method using scikit-learn library.
    1. Use the glass dataset available in Link also provided in your assignment.
    2. Use train_test_split to create training and testing part.
2. Evaluate the model on testing part using score and classification_report

1. Implement linear SVM method using scikit library
    1. Use the glass dataset available in Link also provided in your assignment.
    2. Use train_test_split to create training and testing part.
2. Evaluate the model on testing part using score and classification_report


## Softwares Required :
1. Python 3
2. Github Desktop
3. pycharm

## Implementation:
1. Assignment was provided with steps for titanic dataset.
2. We need to run the preprocessing_EDA file to preprocess the data before sending it to the model for input
3. preprocessing_EDA provides test_preprocessed and train_preprocessed as ouput and this is used for training and testing the model.
4. Glass dataset requires no preprocessing, hence we split the data into training and testing data and send it to the model.


## Tasks Performed
### **Question 1: Code Development**

# 
Step 1: We need to run preprocessing_EDA(Question1).ipynb to get the preprocessed data.

Step 2: test_preprocessed and train_preprocessed are in the git folder

Step 3: Run the Naive(Question1).ipynb file to train and test the model.

Comments, Inferences, results are written with full explanations within jupyter notebook.

please run the KNN.ipynb for better understanding with comments.

**Naïve Bayes method is implemented in the KNN.ipynb file.**

### **Question 2: Code Development**

Step 1: extracted the glass dataset and visaulized the data to understand better.

Step  2: applied naives and SVM algorithms.
